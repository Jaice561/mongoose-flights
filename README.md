# mongoose-flights
Flights is a web app where the user will be able to create a flight list.
The user will be able to see the detail about the flight on the detail page by click the the detail link.
Inside the detail page, the user will also be able to add or edit a destination.

This app doesn't have that much css in it, and that's something i'm willing to do in the future, but all the functionality work.
